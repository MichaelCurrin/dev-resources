# About

A dev encyclopedia quick reference.

Including:

- Definitions and a short explanation of what something is and why/when to use it
- Links to the homepage, tutorials and docs
- Links to installation guides (in my gists or other repos).


## Aim

The idea is to focus on **links** to resources, as a quick reference or favorite links or bookmarks, but shared publically.

With the aim to reduce friction so I can drop in links and titles in a CMS and not care about styling except at a theme level. Also, I can reduce duplication by pooling say React resources and linking to them from multiple repos.

The plan is **not** to cover detailed paragraphs or actual syntax rules or samples (except maybe for Hello World)
