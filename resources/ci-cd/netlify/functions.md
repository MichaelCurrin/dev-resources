title: Functions
description: A free serverless service that acts as a wrapper on AWS Lambdas, but much easier to deploy 
---

Rather than dealing with deploying to AWS using AWS console or CLI or Terraform, for Netlify all you have to do is put code in a directory like `.netlify/functions` and push your code. Netlify will create your endpoints.
