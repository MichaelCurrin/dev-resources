Deploy and host your app as a serverless app, for free.

On a domain like `my-app.vercel.app`.

You might run a Node Express or Python Flask server there, which will get converted to a bunch of serverless endpoints, without having to rebuild your app from scratch to be serverless.

I don't know of any other sites that give this convenience. It saves a lot of effort managing infrastructure and deploys yourself on AWS.

Vercel is also the org behind Next.js and so they are pushing to get your to deploy a Next.js app on their site. With a mixture of modes to handle backend server, static rendering and SPA.

Or you could just run static HTML on Vercel, maybe with Jekyll. But then you might as well use GH Pages or Netlify or CloudFare Pages.
