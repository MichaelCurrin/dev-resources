### Overview 

- Compiled - once across operating systems. 
- Interpreted by Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Statically and strongly typed
- Garbage collected - so doesn't need low level memory management like C or C++.
- Mainly Object-orientated but supports Functional Programming.


### Usage

Compile to binary:

```sh
$ javac HelloWorld.java
```

Execute the binary using Java runtime.

```sh
$ java HelloWorld
```

Binaries are "class" files. Multiple files can be distributed as a zipped Java Archive - a `.jar` file. [Source](
