      "jspm.dev native modules CDN for npm documentation."

      e.g. `https://jspm.dev/@babel/core`
      e.g. `https://dev.jspm.io/react-dom@17.0.1/server`
      e.g. `https://dev.jspm.io/react` or `https://dev.jspm.io/react@16.5` or `https://dev.jspm.io/react@16.5.0`
      e.g. `https://dev.jspm.io/npm:react@16.5.0` with `npm` explicitly (you also get this sometimes when the server redirects you).

      "All packages from npm are precomputed and served through jspm.dev and are available at their corresponding URLs."

      This service already gives you **ES Module** format for `type="module"` script tags, so you don't need a flag to choose that.

      You can find a minified and dev/prod versions of a package. See [/npm:react@17.0.2/cjs/](https://dev.jspm.io/npm:react@17.0.2/cjs/) for example.
    
      If you want to add a source map, use the [Generator](https://generator.jspm.io/). That lets you specify package names and then generate an import map, polyfill for import maps, and a script tag using your imports. In some cases, an import map is actually necessary to prevent imports within a loaded module from breaking.
      
  - title: Unpkg
    url: https://unpkg.com/

      "unpkg is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on npm."

      Format: `unpkg.com/PACKAGE@VERSION/FILE`

      e.g. `unpkg.com/react@16.7.0/umd/react.production.min.js`

      The default I think is to get CommonJS (`.cjs`) format. 
      
      To get the ES Module form, add the `?module` parameter. That changes imports within loaded modules.

      e.g.
      
      [/primevue@3.4.0/ripple/ripple.esm.js](https://unpkg.com/primevue@3.4.0/ripple/ripple.esm.js) starts off as:

          import { DomHandler } from 'primevue/utils';

      And that will cause errors with ES Modules- unless you can an import map to process `primevue` as an UNPKG URL.

      But adding the extension like [/primevue@3.4.0/ripple/ripple.esm.js?module](https://unpkg.com/primevue@3.4.0/ripple/ripple.esm.js?module) does this:

          import { DomHandler }
          from "https://unpkg.com/primevue@latest/utils?module";

      Unfortunately, that uses `latest` in its URL and not the `3.X.X` version from the URL. And also in this case, the latest points at `2.X.X` (redirects to `https://unpkg.com/primevue@2.4.1/utils?module`) and that is appears as an error.

      > "A New-Age CDN for JavaScript modules. Load modern JavaScript packages built for you on-demand. Works in modern web browsers, node.js, and deno."

      Supports **ES Modules**.

      URL format: `https://esm.run/PACKAGE`

      e.g. `https://esm.run/d3` and redirects to `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3/+esm`.

      That says it was bundled with Rollup and Terser.
