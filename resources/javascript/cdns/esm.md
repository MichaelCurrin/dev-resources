Supports **ES Modules** i.e. `import` rather than `require`. It appears that the service converts packages in the old format to be available with the new format.

The name of the site of course reflects ES Modules aka ESM.

URL format: `https://esm.run/PACKAGE`

e.g. `https://esm.run/d3` redirects to `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3/+esm`.

The result says it was bundled with Rollup and Terser.
