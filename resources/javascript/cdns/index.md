Pick one of these CDNs to download packages. The default behavior is usually to get a package which was published on the NPM website.

### Sample CDN URLs

- [https://unpkg.com/apexcharts@3.29.0/dist/apexcharts.common.js](https://unpkg.com/apexcharts@3.29.0/dist/apexcharts.common.js)
- [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/apexcharts@3.29](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/apexcharts@3.29)

### Modules

The format differs across CDNs and some of them let you choose between CommonJS, ES Modules, etc. See [Modules][] cheatsheets for info on these formats and how to apply them. 

Specifically, see the [ES Modules][] cheatsheet on how to use ES Modules in your app, whether with Node, Deno, or directly in the HTML of your frontend.
