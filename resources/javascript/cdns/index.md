Pick one of these CDNs to download packages. The default behavior is usually to get a package which was published on the NPM website.

Sample URLs:

- [https://unpkg.com/apexcharts@3.29.0/dist/apexcharts.common.js](https://unpkg.com/apexcharts@3.29.0/dist/apexcharts.common.js)
- [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/apexcharts@3.29](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/apexcharts@3.29)


For info on how to use these in your app, see [ES Modules][] cheatsheet.
