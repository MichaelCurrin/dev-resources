description: A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript
wikipedia-excerpt: |
  Deno is a **runtime** for JavaScript and TypeScript that is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language.

  It was created by Ryan Dahl, original creator of Node.js, and is focused on productivity. It was announced by Dahl in 2018 during his talk "10 Things I Regret About Node.js".

  Deno explicitly takes on the role of both **runtime** and **package manager** within a single executable, rather than requiring a separate package-management program.
