title: Minifiers
description: Tools to minify your JS files i.e. make them smaller and faster
---


## About

Minifying the JS code will make it faster for a browser to download and use, at the cost of becoming impractical for a human to read.

Here are some changes applied:

- Rename variables and functions to short names.
- Remove whitespace.
- Strips comments.
- Combines files.
- Tree shaking - remove unused code when importing a library.


## Browser tools

Easy minification tools for those without build tool experience or for quick results. It lets you paste code and generate minified code.
