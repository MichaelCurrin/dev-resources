# Installation


## Package manager

See my gist:

- [Install Node.js and NPM](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/aa1fc56419a355972b96bce23f3bccba)

That covers instructions across operating systems and using a package manager.


## Download installer or zipped binary

Or use this page:

- [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    > Download the Node.js source code or a pre-built installer for your platform, and start developing today. 


## Docker

- [Node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) on Docker Hub.
