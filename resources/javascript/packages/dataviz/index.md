### Comparison

ApexCharts is easy to set up and customize.

It is similar to Highcharts, which I've not used.

You can do a treemap, bubble chart and other visualizations that you'd make in D3. But it is much easier than D3. I found D3 needs a lot of code to get something basic, then you have to research how to do something simple properly like add a tooltip, while ApexCharts has an easy config option. Of course, D3 gives you more control, especially for unconventional chart types.
