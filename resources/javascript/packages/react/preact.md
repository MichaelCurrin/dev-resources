Preact is a lot faster and lighter than React.

It aims to be mostly compatible with React. 

For near 100% compatibility,  Preact offers an additional package: 

 `preact-compat`

Preact is compatible and even encourages using `htm` over JSX, so you can use regular HTML attributes.

See also petite-vue as a light form of Vue.
