### What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React allows us to create reusable UI components, whether adding a component to a plain HTML page or to build the entire page and page routing with React.

React is used to build Single-Page Applications rendered on the client side, but it can also be used for Server-side rendering.

From the [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview) in the docs:

> React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
> 
> It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

    * Based on the Create React App CLI output.
    * CI deploy flow with GitHub Actions.
    * Hosted with GitHub Pages.

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
