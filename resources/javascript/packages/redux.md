## What does Redux do?

Summary from the docs:

> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. (Not to be confused with a WordPress framework – [Redux Framework](https://redux.io))
>
> It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).
>
> You can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.

## Should I use Redux?

Warning from the docs:

> Redux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation. Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.

There are also a ton of posts out there around why you probably **don't** need Redux anymore. Even the Redux author said that.

Also the author of Redux:

> Flux libraries are like glasses: you’ll know when you need them.
