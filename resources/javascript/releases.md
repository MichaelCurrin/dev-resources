Note that no one group releases a new version of JS. There many browsers and at least two server-side runtimes (Node and Deno). These will each follow a specification to bring out new JS features, but they can each implement the feature differently if at all, so you code is not guaranteed to work across browsers especially older ones.

Using Babel and other transpilers helps with this.
