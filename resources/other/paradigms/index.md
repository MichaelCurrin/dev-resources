In this section of pages, I cover definitions of paradigms and links to learn more. For some areas I also cover languages that focus on enable that paradigm.

There over 200 programming languages, so I wouldn't cover them all here.

Paradigms _constrain_ what you can do with a language and gives it focus. The early languages could be used for anything this lack of structure makes it harder.


### Overview

The info below is based on [Comparison of Programming Paradigms][] page on Wikipedia, which uses the "approaches" and "paradigms" groupings.

#### Approaches

There are two main approaches to programming:

- [Imperative Programming][] – focuses on **how** to execute, defines control flow as statements that change a **program state**.
- [Declarative Programming][] – focuses on **what** to execute, defines program logic, but not detailed control flow.

#### Paradigms

The following are widely considered the main programming paradigms, as seen when measuring programming language popularity. These are light comparisons.

From [Comparison of Programming Paradigms][] on Wikipedia.

- [Procedural Programming][] - Specifies the **steps** a program must take to reach a **desired state**.
- [Functional Programming][] - Treats programs as evaluating **mathematical functions**. Avoids state and mutable data.
- [Object-Oriented Programming][] - Organizes programs as objects: data structures consisting of datafields and methods together with their interactions.

These are tools you can use. And you can take learnings from both and apply them, for example avoiding side-effects is a good idea in any of them.

From [Programming Paradigm][] on Wikipedia.

> Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.

That article compares paradigms neatly. Here is a summary from there.

    Common programming paradigms include:

        imperative in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
            procedural which groups instructions into procedures,
            object-oriented which groups instructions with the part of the state they operate on,

        declarative in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
            functional in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,
            logic in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,
            mathematical in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
            reactive in which the desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change

#### Approaches and Paradigms

From [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/QM1iUe6IofM).

| Paradigm   | Approach   | Description        |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Procedural | Imperative | The default style. |
| Procedural | Functional | Minimize state.    |
| OOP        | Imperative | Segregate state.   |

Another option from the video, which doesn't fit in the table, is that can mix OOP and FP. do both paradigms in one project in different modules or even in the same one. See [Mix FP and OOP][] page for more info.
