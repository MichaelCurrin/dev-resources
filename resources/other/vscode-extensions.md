## Beginner guides

### Extension docs

- [Your First Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) in the docs

### Sample projects

- [MichaelCurrin/vsc-extension-quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/vsc-extension-quickstart) GH repo
    - My repo which contains an auto-generated Hello World extension.
    - I added detailed [docs](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/vsc-extension-quickstart/tree/master/docs#vs-code-extension-quickstart-docs) explaining how the extension works and how to install and use it locally.
    - It is available as a _template_ repo so you can create get your own copy.
- [VSCode Extension Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples#vs-code-extension-samples)
    - This is good to look at once you're familiar with one of the simple setups above.
    - This Samples repo by Microsoft contains many variations of extensions that demonstrate functionality.
    - Use one of the directories in their as a starting point for one of your projects, or just use pieces you need from each. There are GIFs in each to give a nice preview.
    - In particular, see:
        - [Hello World Minimal Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/helloworld-minimal-sample)
        - [Hello World Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/helloworld-sample) without tests
        - [Hello World Test Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/helloworld-test-sample) which includes tests.

## More extensions
> Some extensions I'd like to recommend

- [MichaelCurrin/auto-commit-msg](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/auto-commit-msg#readme)
    > Generate descriptive commit messages based on files to be committed without touching your keyboard
    - I wrote this as my first extension. It is still work in progress but it is working and has a nice flow of tests and installation. It was based heavily on the two extensions listed next.
- [Git Semantic Commit](https://github.com/nitayneeman/vscode-git-semantic-commit)
- [Git Prefix](https://github.com/srmeyers/git-prefix)

You can also find _any_ extension in the marketplace and find a link to the GH repo. Look at the code yourself and use it as a reference or fork a repo.
