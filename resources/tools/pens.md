## About

Mostly for HTML, CSS and JS, some also run other server-side languages.

A pen or sandbox supports development within an online IDE.

It makes it easy to create and test a demo. You can usually login and share a link so others can see your code and run it and see the resuls.

Some like CodePen provide easy loading of JS packages and of transpiling like JSX, Pug, Less, SASS, etc. Saving effort setting up a local dev environment or a full site.
