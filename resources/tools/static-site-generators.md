# Static Site Generators

There are plenty more but these are the ones I am interested in or use.

See also [JAMStack][] section.

[JAMStack]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/other/jamstack.md %}

- [Hugo]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/go/packages/hugo.md %})
- [Jekyll]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/jekyll/index.md %})
- [VuePress]({ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/javascript/packages/vuepress/index.md %})
- [Next.js]({ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/javascript/packages/next/index.md %})
- [Nuxt]({ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/javascript/packages/nuxt/index.md %})


## Documentation site generators

- [MkDocs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/python/libraries/mkdocs.md %})
- [mdBook]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/rust/packages/mdbook.md %})
- [RustDoc]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/rust/rustdoc.md %})
- [Docsify]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/javascript/packages/docsify/index.md %}) - actually SPA, not a static site generator yet.
- [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/)
    - This is different enough from V1 that it is considered a different tool.
- [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)
    - > Where software teams break knowledge silos.
      >
      > GitBook helps you publish beautiful docs for your users and centralize your teams' knowledge for advanced collaboration. 
    - There's a free mode for one site only I think.
    - I don't think you can run GitBook standalone (such as a locally). It is has a level of paid service.
    - You can optionally connect your site to GitHub for editing and backup.
    - Alterntives
      - Consider mdBook which is a more flexible open source solution which is meant to look like GitBook.
      - See MkDocs - it has a [themes](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes) section in the Wiki which has a GitBook-style theme. See the [preview](https://lramage.gitlab.io/mkdocs-gitbook-theme/).
