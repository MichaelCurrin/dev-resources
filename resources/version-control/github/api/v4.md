> You can use the GitHub GraphQL API to create precise and flexible queries for the data you need to integrate with GitHub.

I have a couple of examples of GQL queries as gists - see my [Gist viewer](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/gist-viewer/).

## API endpoint

Do authenticated POST requests here.

- `https://api.github.com/graphql`

Using cURL, Python/Node script or server, Insomnia/Postman, a Lambda, etc.

Avoid doing frontend queries as you then have to expose your token in the browser to users who can abuse it.
