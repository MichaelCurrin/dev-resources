> You can use the GitHub GraphQL API to create precise and flexible queries for the data you need to integrate with GitHub.

I have a couple of examples of GQL queries as gists - see my [Gist viewer](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/gist-viewer/).

My repos that use the GH GQL API:

- [GitHub Reporting Tool](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/github-reporting-py) tool written in Python. In particular, see the [queries](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/github-reporting-py/tree/master/ghgql/queries) directory.
- [MichaelCurrin/github-gql-go](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/github-gql-go)
- [MichaelCurrin/github-gql-ruby](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/github-gql-ruby)
