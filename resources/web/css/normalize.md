## What does it do?

> - Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.
> - Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.
> - Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
> - Improves usability with subtle modifications.
> - Explains what code does using detailed comments.


## Normalize vs reset

> Resets impose a homogenous visual style by flattening the default styles for almost all elements. 
> 
> In contrast, `normalize.css` retains many useful default browser styles. This means that you donâ€™t have to redeclare styles for all the common typographic elements.
