# GitHub Topics

PNG icons used for GitHub topics on the GitHub website, available for use in other projects too. The portfolio site repo you get when making a new GitHub account uses these icons.


## About

See [Topics](https://github.com/topics/) section on GitHub. A lot of those have icons you can use. In fact, the default profile project you get with a GH repo uses those icons for interests - see [MichaelCurrin.github.io](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/).

The icons have a transparent background - some look poor on a whitebackground.

You can use `master` for the latest, or a commit reference to lock it.


## Format of icon

- Complex image logo.
- PNG format.
- Usually with multiple colors.
- Transparent background. Mostly looks good against white but some have poor contrast.

Square of around 300 pixels. It will not scale well if you need something larger. It will slow your page if you load a lot on one page even if used as small icons - since they are loaded are full size.
