Now part of the W3C standard.

WebAssembly is low level text that looks like Assembly and compiles to a binary which runs in the browser with near native performance.

You can write code say a game in C++, then compile to WebAssembly and a binary. 

WebAssembly doesn't replace JavaScript but works well with it. For example, one side uses React for the UI outline and WebAssembly for the contents.
